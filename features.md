# Characteristics of Web 3

- Decentralization: Web 3 is built upon decentralized technologies like blockchain, enabling networks that are controlled by users rather than centralized entities. This decentralized architecture empowers individuals, fostering peer-to-peer interactions and creating a culture of trust and transparency.

- Interconnectivity: Web 3 revolutionizes the online landscape by promoting interoperability and seamless communication among diverse platforms and applications. It creates a connected ecosystem where information and functionality can effortlessly flow across different systems, enabling efficient collaboration and access to resources.

- Security and Privacy: Web 3 prioritizes the protection of user security and privacy. It employs robust encryption, secure identity management systems, and other privacy-enhancing technologies to safeguard user data from unauthorized access and ensure confidentiality.

- Tokenization: Web 3 introduces the concept of tokenization, where digital assets are represented as tokens on a blockchain. These tokens can represent ownership, value, or access rights, enabling new forms of decentralized applications, digital economies, and innovative business models.

- Community-driven: Web 3 fosters community collaborations and engagement. It encourages active participation, allowing individuals to have a voice in decision-making processes and contributing to the development of the ecosystem.

- Openness and Transparency: Web 3 promotes openness and transparency through decentralized systems, smart contracts, and verifiable data. It removes the reliance on intermediaries, enabling participants to confidently engage, knowing that transactions and interactions are recorded and accessible to all.
